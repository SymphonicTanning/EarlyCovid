# Early Treatment of Covid-19

It has been the policy of the health care establishment to not treat early
Covid-19. Unfortunately, early mild cases can develop into severe cases.
Mild cases which do not worsen can have after-effects several months
after "recovery" - including disabling or fatal after-effects. 

Presently, three drugs are approved by the FDA for early Covid-19. Two
are not effective, and the third is not widely available: Remdesivir is
ineffective and toxic; the Eli Lilly antibody treatment is merely
ineffective; Regeneron's monoclonal antibody cocktail is effective but
scarce. All three require administration in a hospital. It is projected 
that the next few months are going to see an increased denial of 
hospital admissions due to overcrowding, which may impact the accessibility
of the early treatments, even if they do not require full admission.

Another catch-22: policy has been that Covid-19 does not get treatment until
patients require supplemental oxygen. If you require supplemental
oxygen, your case is probably too far along to benefit from the early
treatments. So, although the existing doses of the monoclonal antibody
drugs are scarce, they aren't being used where they are available. You
may be able to get them by asking for them specifically, or calling the
manufacturer's hotline.

This is a bad situation, but there are things you can do to protect yourself.
The purpose of the following to is to arm you with knowledge when dealing 
with doctors, or when taking your Covid-19 medical plan into your own hands. 


## Two Pathways to Infection

SARS-CoV-2 infects cells via multiple pathways, of which one is the
primary pathway (ACE2 receptors on lung epithelial cells) and another is
the most significant secondary pathway (the endosomes of cells which
find wider expression outside the lungs). Both pathways can be targeted
using common drugs.


### Using OTC Bromhexine to Block the Primary Pathway.

The SARS-CoV-2 virus uses your body's own enzymes to prime itself for
cell entry. A crucial serine protease enzyme used by SARS-CoV-2 is
called TMPRSS2. With its spike sliced open by TMPRSS2, SARS-CoV-2 is
able to fuse to a cell after binding to ACE2 receptors on the cell's
surface. It follows that if you could inhibit the production of TMPRSS2, 
you would disrupt SARS-CoV-2's ability to fuse to cells. Of the two 
major pathways which SARS-CoV-2 uses, this is the one which finds 
greatest expression in the lungs, which is the most critical locus of 
infection.

Options are limited: there's a prescription TMPRSS2 inhibitor called
Camostat, which is not available in the US. If you don't want to tangle
with offshore pharmacies, the only drug available to ordinary people is
an OTC cough medicine called Bromhexine, which is available in Europe
and Asia, and in the US via eBay. Bromhexine is not a TMPRSS2 inhibitor.
Its action is to cause your body to increase production of endogenous
TMPRSS2 inhibitors in pulmonary surfactant. Bromhexine is broken down in
your liver to its active component Ambroxol - also an OTC mucolytic
available on eBay. If you credit the various successful trials and
observational studies which have been conducted for Bromhexine,
Bromhexine and/or Ambroxol could be good ways to protect yourself, in
addition to mask wearing and social distancing - although they would
work best in dual therapy with another drug which acts in the endosomal
route.


### Closing the Secondary Pathway Using Endosomal Entry Inhibitors.

There is a secondary path used by SARS-CoV-2 to enter cells: via
cellular endosomes. SARS-CoV-2 enters endosomes using enzymes dependent
on an acidic environment. It follows that if you could inhibit the
acidification of endosomes, you would disrupt SARS-CoV-2's ability to
enter them. There are prescription medications capable of doing this,
including nitazoxanide, niclosamide, and hydroxychloroquine. Of these,
the only one readily available in the US is hydroxychloroquine (HCQ).
Nitazoxanide has been approved by the FDA for a different use, but is
extremely expensive in the US relative to other countries and to HCQ.

This is unfortunate, since HCQ developed serious political problems
after Donald Trump promoted it, to the extent that it was totally
discredited. The prominent Oxford RECOVERY clinical trial, which
inappropriately used HCQ as the sole antiviral therapy in advanced
patients, also contributed to HCQ's reputational damage, despite the
study's report explicitly stating that it did "not address its use as
prophylaxis or in patients with less severe SARS-CoV-2 infection." If
all you know about HCQ is what you have read in the New York Times or
heard on NPR, you'd think HCQ was snake oil. But there have been upwards
of 180 studies using HCQ to treat Covid-19, and many of them show
favorable results - with qualifications: it should be used early, and
it's not terribly effective when used alone. Notably, a randomized
controlled trial using Bromhexine and HCQ together had success.

Although HCQ is readily available, the discrediting of HCQ has
made it less likely that you'll be able to get it to use in a dual
therapy to stop Covid-19. The bright side is that Bromhexine alone may
be fairly effective solo, at least in the lungs, since the endosomal
path there does not find wide expression.

OTC alternatives to block viral entrance via endosomes don't have much
in the way of studies to back them up, but they do exist: proton pump
inhibitors like Nexium have weak endosomal action. It would require a
really high dose with untenable side-effects to have as large an effect
as HCQ, but a normal dose might at least offer some support. Artemisinin
is a herbal supplement currently in clinical trials for Covid. It can be
purchased on Amazon. It is an anti-malarial medicine with antiviral
effects. It too has possibly unpleasant side effects.


## Broadly Acting Antiviral Drugs

### Ivermectin

There is another medication which is now seeing success in clinical
trials: Ivermectin. Ivermectin is an anti-parasite medicine used widely
in areas where parasitical infections are common.

Ivermectin had some bad press several months ago in the context of
Covid-19. In one case, an influential study which had resulted in
widespread Ivermectin adoption in some regions was found to be terribly
flawed; in another, an in-vitro study showed that massive doses were
required to have an antiviral effect against SARS-CoV-2, at least in a
petri dish.

Now, months later, every single RCT or clinical study using Ivermectin
in human patients has succeeded. Massive doses are not required. It
works in mild, moderate, and severe cases, as well as post-exposure
prophylaxis, although not solely as an antiviral. It has
immunomodulatory and anti-inflammatory effects, including supporting the
action of T-cells to fight infection.  Ivermectin has a long half-life,
so requires infrequent doses. It is inexpensive and available
everywhere. 

There is a movement among some front-line physicians to try to get
Ivermectin adopted in the US as the preferred treatment. One stumbling
block is that it is cheap and generic, so the profit motive is not there
(in the third quarter, Gilead sold $873 million of Remdesivir, before
WHO declared it ineffective). Another obstacle is that the earlier
studies have falsely discredited it. Odds are you'd have to argue, arm
yourself with print-outs of the clinical trials, or lie to your doctor
to get it prescribed, at least for now. The one possible drawback is
that it has been reputed to have neurotoxic effects in patients with a
compromised blood brain barrier, although that has not been reported in
any of the Covid-19 trials.

### Nitazoxanide

Yet another anti-protozoal drug which also acts as a broad spectrum
antiviral, nitazoxanide acts on both viral routes, inhibiting SARS-CoV-2
at the endosomal pathway and the fusion-based cell surface non-endosomal
pathway. It acts not only against the TMPRSS2 enzyme, but also the furin
enzyme which prepares the virus for activation by TMPRSS2. In the
endosomal pathway nitazoxanide is known to have multiple inhibitory
actions. Nitazoxanide also dampens the inflammatory cytokine storm while
simultaneously stimulating the innate immune responses. Although it
appears to work in monotherapy, paired with Bromhexine or Camostat it
should be even more effective. Nitazoxanide is known to work in the
post-exposure and early stages of Covid-19, while Ivermectin appears to
work at all stages. Further testing may reveal that Nitazoxanide is also
effective in the advanced stages when the dose is adjusted upwards. In
the most thorough study yet, a Brazilian RCT which looked at early-stage
use, "Nitazoxanide did not accelerate symptom resolution after 5 days of
therapy; however, reduced viral load significantly with no serious
adverse events."

### Niclosamide

Niclosamide is an anti-parasitic used to cure tapeworm infections. In the
context of Covid-19, it is a proton ionophore, allowing H+ to diffuse 
back out of endosomes and lysosomes, raising the pH, and thereby preventing
Sars-CoV-2 from entering via the endosomal route. Thus, it works like
nitazoxanide, with which it shares additional post-entry antiviral 
effects. The antiviral action of niclosamide and nitazoxanide make them
superior to HCQ, which only acts as an entry inhibitor. Niclosamide does
not have the same clinical trial history as the other two drugs, so its
anti-Covid-19 reputation is largely anecdotal, but the mechanism of action
is theoretically sound.

## OTC Anti-platelet Therapy

Another medication to be aware of is aspirin. Aspirin is an
anti-platelet drug. Severe Covid is characterized by platelet
hyper-reactivity, which leads clotting, tissue damage and excessive
serotonin in the blood. This is why anti-coagulants like Heparin are
used to fight severe Covid, and why the serotonin antagonist famotidine
(Pepcid AC) is given to some patients. It might be wise to try to stop
the platelet hyper-reactivity before it starts; that is, to use
anti-platelets before you have to resort to anti-coagulants. Aspirin or
Naproxen (not both together), are capable of supporting this. A
fractional dose of Aspirin (80 to 160 mg) is all that is required. The
science on this is not clear, however - there's some limited evidence
that aspirin or NSAIDs might not be effective or do harm. No one really
knows. A prescription alternative would be the drug dipyridamole. There
are also reports that the first-generation antihistamine cyproheptadine
has been successfully used in severe cases to block serotonin-involved
hyper-coagulation.


## OTC Supplements with SARS-CoV-2 Antiviral Activity.

### Vitamin D
Vitamin D has long been known to have immunomodulatory and
antiviral effects. Specific to SARS-CoV-2, it is proposed that Vitamin D
upregulates an antimicrobial peptide, LL-37, which binds to the
SARS-CoV-2 S protein and prevents it binding to your ACE2 receptors,
likely inhibiting viral entry into the cell. That is, Vitamin D augments
the same antiviral process as TMPRSS2 inhibitors like Bromhexine, by a
different mechanism. OTC Vitamin D takes 7 to 10 days to take effect.
There's a prescription-only version of Vitamin D, calcifediol, which is
much faster acting.

### Quercetin
Quercetin displays a broad range of antiviral properties which may
interfere at multiple steps - virus entry, virus replication, protein
assembly. These therapeutic effects may be augmented by the
co-administration of vitamin C. There has been at least one study which
has shown Quercetin/Bromelain/Vitamin C is an effective prophylaxis
against Covid-19.

Prescription drugs with RCTs showing effective results against Covid 19:

- dipyridamole - anti-platelet medication which also exhibits anti-inflammatory	and antiviral action.
- colchicine - anti-inflammatory.
- daclatasvir-sofosbuvir - dual antiviral. 
- nebulized interferon - causes your body to release its endogenous antiviral defenses.
- umifenovir - antiviral used in Russia and China to treat flu and colds. Some positive results when used early.
- Fluvoxamine - an SSRI used to treat OCD, fluvoxamine is a potent serotonin-antagonist with other relevant effects, such as androgen suppression, acid sphingomyelinase inhibition in endosomes, and sigma agonism. SSRIs have anti-inflammatory and antiplatelet effects, that is, reduce G9a activity and deplete platelet serotonin. Fluvoxamine weakly inhibits viral endosomal entry. As a Sigma ligand it has post-entry antiviral effects.
